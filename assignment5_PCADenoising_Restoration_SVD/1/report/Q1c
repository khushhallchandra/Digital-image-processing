Bilateral filtering on the other hand does not reduce dimensionality. It might remove noise by "smoothing" the image. It is just one group of image filters. But it is filtering technique not denoising. Denoising implies explicitly noise removal.  Filtering implies one can apply any "filter" into an image . In other words, denoising is filtering, but not all filtering is denoising. PCA is one way to reduce dimensionality. PCA is used for denoising. Hence we observe that PCA is better than bilateral fitering.
